# Mental Health Counseling Bot with FastMCP

This document explains the FastMCP implementation for the Mental Health Counseling Bot.

## Overview

FastMCP is a library that provides a server implementation for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows you to:

1. Define tools as Python functions
2. Register tools with the MCP server
3. Run the MCP server to handle requests

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- FastMCP library
- Other dependencies listed in pyproject.toml

## Implementation

The FastMCP implementation consists of the following components:

### 1. FastMCP Server (`fastmcp_implementation.py`)

This file contains the FastMCP server implementation, including:

- Initialization of the FastMCP server
- Registration of tools
- Running the server

### 2. Tools

The following tools are registered with the FastMCP server:

- `pubmed_search`: Search PubMed for mental health research
- `arxiv_search`: Search Arxiv for mental health research
- `web_search`: Search the web for mental health resources
- `rag_search`: Use RAG to find relevant mental health information

## Usage

To use the FastMCP implementation:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```
3. Run the FastMCP server:
   ```
   python fastmcp_implementation.py
   ```

## Benefits of FastMCP

The FastMCP implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Simple Tool Definition**: Define tools as Python functions with decorators
2. **Automatic Tool Registration**: Tools are automatically registered with the server
3. **Standardized Interface**: Provides a standardized interface for tool execution
4. **Context Management**: Manages context for tool execution
5. **Transport Flexibility**: Supports different transport mechanisms (stdio, http, etc.)

## Integration with Mental Health Counseling Bot

The FastMCP implementation integrates with the Mental Health Counseling Bot by:

1. Providing tools for mental health research and counseling
2. Managing context for mental health counseling
3. Handling requests for mental health advice

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to the FastMCP implementation could include:

1. **More Tools**: Add more tools for mental health counseling
2. **Context Persistence**: Persist context between sessions
3. **User-specific Context**: Support for user-specific context
4. **Advanced Tool Integration**: More advanced tool integration with parameter validation
5. **Web Interface**: Add a web interface for the FastMCP server
